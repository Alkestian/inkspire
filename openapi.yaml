    Cache-Control:
      description: |
        The Cache-Control header communicates directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses. 
        It is used to specify the caching directives in responses to prevent caches from storing sensitive information.
      schema:
        type: string
        description: A comma-separated list of directives as defined in [RFC 9111](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html).

          - max-age=3600
          - max-age=604800, public
          - no-store
          - no-cache
          - private

    RateLimit:
      description: |
        The RateLimit header communicates quota policies. It contains a `limit` to
        convey the expiring limit, `remaining` to convey the remaining quota units,
        and `reset` to convey the time window reset time.
      schema:
        type: string
        examples:
          - limit=10, remaining=0, reset=10

    Retry-After:
      description: |
        The Retry-After header indicates how long the user agent should wait before making a follow-up request. 
        The value is in seconds and can be an integer or a date in the future. 
        If the value is an integer, it indicates the number of seconds to wait. 
        If the value is a date, it indicates the time at which the user agent should make a follow-up request.
      schema:
        type: string
      examples:
        integer:
          value: "120"
          summary: Retry after 120 seconds
        date:
